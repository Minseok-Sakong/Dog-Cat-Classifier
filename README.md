# Dog-Cat-Classifier

The goal of the project is to design a MATLAB based image classification model that classifies pictures of dogs and cats. Each module extracts information from pictures by calculating means, variances, covariances, and Gaussian distribution. The image classifier is trained based on LDA, nearest neighbor, perceptron, and closest average models.
